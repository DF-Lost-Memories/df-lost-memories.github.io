    <h2>Okay, what's THIS?</h2>
    <p>The secret flipside of Lost Memories that focuses on content that's exclusive to the 2018 demo...?</p>
    <h2>But why is it completely separate from everything</h2>
    <p>Simply put, Demo 2 is a completely different game than everything that came after it, and has way too much unused content that's exclusive to itself.</p>
    <p>Since almost none of it was carried over to future versions and almost everything was related to the full game that Demo 2 was intended to become, I decided to separate these articles into a separate page instead of flooding the main page with them.</p>
    <p>Things that originated from Demo 2 but are still present in later versions are still listed in Lost Memories.</p>
    <h2 title="(No one asked that)">Are the rules the same?</h2>
    <p>Well, I'm glad you asked! They aren't.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Content ripped straight from the game files IS allowed. <span title="Check out the Resources page in Lost Memories!">The unencrypted data.win is publicly available</span>, and <span style="color: var(--rickyg)">RickyG</span> has given permission for content to be shared from it.</li>
        <li>Modding is also allowed for documentation purposes. However, you can't connect this version to GMS, and you can't distribute mods.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Okay, that's it. Have fun!</p>
