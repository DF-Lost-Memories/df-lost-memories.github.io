    <h2>What's this?</h2>
    <p>As stated in the home page, DF: Lost Memories is a website where I (<span style="color: var(--hflyer)">High Flyer</span>) document unused content I find in DONTFORGET, all the way from the 2018 demo to the latest version of the game (the Old Beta and Classic Multiplayer not included).</p>
    <p>The videos and screenshots here will mostly be by me. The authors will be credited otherwise.</p>
    <p>All articles are categorized based on which version the content originated from.</p>
    <p>I also use a different vessel and color for each category, to make them easier to recognize at a glance. I use <span style="color: var(--demo2);">Frisk (Dark Purple)</span> for Demo 2, <span style="color: var(--chapter1);">Harlow (Purple)</span> for Chapter 1, <span style="color: var(--olddfc);">Kris (Blue??)</span> for Old DFC, and <span style="color: var(--newdfc);">Quote (Orange)</span> for New DFC.</p>
    <p style="color: var(--demo2)">Content exclusive to Demo 2 is listed on a separate page, known as Lost Timelines.</p>
    <p>(Tip: If you see <span title="Yeah! Like that!">text with a dotted underline</span>, hover over it for more info)</p>
    <h2>How can I help?</h2>
    <p>By finding unused content? You can also check to see if any of the unused content in available in versions older than their listed "first version" or newer than their "last version".</p>
    <p>You can also make room ID lists for versions that don't have them. It <em>might</em> not be incredibly useful for v2.X versions but one for v1.3.3 would be much appreciated.</p>
    <p>Finally, if you have any old DF versions archived, please send them to me. Especially...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Android ones, as there's already an archive of almost every Windows v2.X build.</li>
        <li>Older Chapter 1 builds. Specifically, v1.0.0 would be very nice to have, so I can know if some things have been in the game since the very beginning or not.</li>
        <li>Older Demo 2 builds, for the same reason as above. v0.1.0 would be really cool.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you're on this website, you might already know me on Discord. My username is, unsurprisingly, <span style="color: var(--hflyer);">hflyer</span>.</p>
    <h2>Well how DO I find unused content</h2>
    <p>That's honestly a good question. If I were you I would just go back to older versions and edit the save file to go to different room IDs. I haven't really explored a lot of versions other than v1.3.3, v2.4.3b and v2.7.9c.</p>
    <p>Or, if you know what you're doing, you might be able to look at the game's files. However...</p>
    <h2>There are rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No content ripped straight from the game files.<br>You <em>could</em> look at the files for ways to find unused content in-game; but if it's not in-game through "legitimate" methods like save editing, noclipping, the map editor, or any other way that doesn't involve straight up modding the game, then it won't be posted here.</li>
        <li>No decompiling. If you know what I mean by "looking at the game's files", you know that it doesn't, and shouldn't, give you access to the actual code. As such, unused content that's found by looking at decompiled code will not be accepted.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color: var(--demo2)">Note: For Demo 2, sharing content from the files (and modding, to an extent) for documentation's sake is allowed.<br>Mods for this version may not be distributed, however.</p>
    <p>That's about it. Have fun!</p>
