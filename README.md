## Contributing
Please read the about page in the website to see how you can help. While you can just DM me whatever you want to add on Discord (hflyer), here's what you need to know if you really want to contribute through GitHub:

For new articles, you will first need to add their metadata to `assets/articles/articles.json`. Then, make a folder in `assets/articles/` with the article ID you used, and make an HTML file inside with the same name. This snippet of will be inserted into `article.html`, however you can reference assets as if the HTML file you created was the one being viewed. And yes: any images, videos or audio should be included in your folder as well. Which may not be an amazing idea...

...but what do I know.

For anything else you may want to add, everything is just plain HTML. There's even a folder specifically for room lists if you want to add to that.
