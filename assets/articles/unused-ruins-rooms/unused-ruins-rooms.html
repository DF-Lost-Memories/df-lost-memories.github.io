        <h3>Collapsed Floor</h3>
        <video src="collapsedfloor.mp4" controls></video>
        <p>This is room 261 in v2.4.3b. It was meant to be placed between the "Lone Frog" room and the rock puzzle on this page.</p>
        <p>In the room, there's a sign that reads:</p>
        <img class="textbox" data-text="Okay so we weren't        actually able to fix        this room.">
        <img class="textbox" data-text="Most of the floor has           collapsed... but it's         still safe!">
        <img class="textbox" data-text="Probably.                       - RUINS RENOVATION TEAM">
        <p>Most of the floor has, in fact collapsed. There's only a narrow path remaining that goes to the exit and it's possible to fall off, in which case you will be teleported back to the start.</p>
        <p>Spikes block the exit. <span title="There might've once been some sort of puzzle here, which is not present due to a bug.">It's not possible to deactivate them</span>, but noclipping through them leads you to the rock puzzle room.</p>

        <h3>"Rock Puzzle"</h3>
        <video src="rockpuzzle.mp4" controls></video>
        <p>This is room 26 in v2.4.3b. It was meant to be placed between the aforementioned collapsed floor room and "Mouse Hole" save point.</p>
        <p>Inside it is a sign that reads:</p>
        <img class="textbox" data-text='"Only a rock can deactivate  the spikes by sitting on     the plate."'>
        <img class="textbox" data-text="...But there isn't a rock     in this room!\nWhat should you do?">
        <p>There are a set of spikes blocking the way and a button, which can only be pressed by a rock.</p>
        <p>To progress, the player must use the Rock vessel to press the button.</p>
        <p>Exiting this room through the right puts you near the Mouse Hole save point.</p>
        <p>Through the left exit, the room connects to the room now named "Lone Frog"</p>
