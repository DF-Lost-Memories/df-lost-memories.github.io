<p>Chapter 1 has 3 unused rooms that are notably labeled as "Surface" instead of "Hometown".</p>
<p>Or at least that's what I've gathered by looking at the strings in Cheat Engine. All of the ones labeled "Hometown" seem to be used, but there are <span title="Curiously, rooms in Harlow's house are also labeled as 'Surface'?">only two unused "Surface" names</span> and 3 of these unused rooms, so I'm not sure which one is "Surface - Fields".</p>

    <h3>Surface - Fields (?)</h3>

<p>Room 138 is a large room with lots of tall grass and two wormholes leading to levels 5 and 6. There are also two exits that go to completely unrelated rooms and one that just goes out of bounds.</p>
<p>In the genocide route, the tileset is corrupted, the Froggit NPC is gone and the sign's interaction text is different.</p>
<p>This room is noticeably similar to a room from Demo 2 which was actually used in that version with the Froggit NPC, two wormholes and two of the exits.</p>

<p>Room 139 contains an XO puzzle! ...that doesn't work. It would've also had a second puzzle if it was finished, but currently in its place is an almost exact copy (one tree stump is missing) of the first puzzle, without the X tiles or the button.</p>
<p>Chara and Asriel are also found in this room each standing next to one of the puzzles, but they can't be interacted with.</p>
<p>After the two puzzles, there's a wormhole that leads to level 5.</p>
<p>This room reacts appropriately to the genocide route, corrupting the tilesets and removing the NPCs. Their collisions stay, though.</p>
<p>If the puzzle worked, this would've been the solution:</p>

<p>Room 146 is a room with tall grass...</p>
<p>As this room doesn't even have Harlow in it, it's completely impossible to move around. So this is really all we can see.</p>
<p>This room also reacts to the genocide route.</p>
