<p>In the files of Demo 2, there's an unused version of the UI used by the machine.</p>
<p>First, a list of things that were modified in the code to make the video possible:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The machine was changed to create obj_newmap instead of obj_selecttimeline.</li>
    <li>obj_soulpieces was changed to work with obj_newmap instead of obj_selecttimeline, and not automatically adjust its position.</li>
    <li>obj_instructions was integrated into the machine (trust me when I say it barely works).</li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth noting that unlike in the final game, where they're referred to as timelines, here the different worlds are called alternate universes.</p>
<p>Everything after the second universe is locked. However, the third one's thumbnail can be seen showing the Beta Void while hovering over the fourth universe.</p>
<p>The help guide mentions Frisk's phone being upgraded. This relates to the <a href="article.html?id=demo2-phone">Demo 2 Phone UI</a> article.</p>
<p>I should also mention that there's some code suggesting that said help guide would've originally appeared after you travel to a different universe for the first time.</p>

    <h3>The second one</h3>

<p>There's... another unused machine UI. This one is only a universe selection screen, like the final version, and includes details about some planned timelines.</p>
<p>For this one, the machine was modified to create obj_map_main, and obj_map_travel had its sprite changed to spr_map_travel.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that this version can go to the Beta Void without any modifications.</p>
<p>The six empty universe slots can also be full.</p>
<p>Four of them are been marked with "g" (for Gaster?) in the code and would've been unlocked when their variables were set (they aren't set by anything in the final version).</p>
<p>The other two use the letter "m", for multiplayer, and would've been accessible in online mode. These two are the Classic Void, and what probably would've been this game's Gold Grind.</p>
<p>Here's what it looks like when all of them are unlocked:</p>
<p>(obj_map_g4 was changed to actually use spr_map_g4)</p>
