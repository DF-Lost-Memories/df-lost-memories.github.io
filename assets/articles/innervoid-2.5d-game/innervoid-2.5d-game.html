<p>The soul piece levels created for the now-scrapped Chapter 1 Redux are fully playable in DFC.</p>
<p>This was tested in 3 different versions specifically:</p>
<ul>
    <li>v2.0.0: Room 262</li>
    <li>v2.4.3b: Room 267</li>
    <li>v2.6.1: Room 276</li>
</ul>
<p>The minigame is the exact same in v2.0.0 and v2.4.3b. It has a few differences compared to v2.6.1, which is the main version that'll be considered on this page.</p>
<p>In traditional soul piece minigame fashion, the player must navigate mazes filled with glitches - only this version is in 2.5D and features Harlow instead of just their SOUL.</p>
<p>The player also gets 2 HP per level and can run by holding [X/SHIFT].</p>
<p>Running out of HP puts you back at the beginning of the level with 2 HP (it was edited out in the videos).</p>
<p>A HUD on the top left shows Harlow's face, HP and invincibility frames as a bar.</p>
<p>Collecting a soul piece immediately transports you to the next level, which is most likely a debug feature and not how it was supposed to work in the story.</p>
<p>After the final level, the game's credits roll... This is most likely a coincidence (the credits room happened to be right after the last level).</p>
<p>There are various signs placed throughout the levels, but their lines aren't set properly so they use dialogue from other parts of the game.</p>
<p>There are also two NPCs in the second level: faceless Chara and Asriel. Talking to either of them crashes the game.</p>

<center><h3>Differences in v2.0.0 and v2.4.3b</h3></center>
<p>First of all, there's an entire level that's completely missing in v2.6.1, placed after the fourth level. It has invisible walls, likely due to a bug.</p>

<p>In levels 1, 3 and 6, secret paths made out of puzzle pieces can be found, leading to collectibles that are most likely the "memory bytes" that would've unlocked the true ending. It's likely that these would've appeared once enough puzzle pieces were collected in the overworld.</p>

<p>Finishing level 2 takes you to an unrelated room (the void hub for v2.0.0 and a void hallway for 2.4.3b). You need to skip to the next room ID (265 and 270 respectively) to continue playing.</p>
<p>Finishing every level takes you to Papyrus's shed, which is also a coincidence but even funnier than the v2.6.1 one.</p>
