<p>As stated in the <a href="https://gamejolt.com/p/december-progress-report-tbsx2yrs" target="_blank">December 2019 Progress Report</a>, v2.0.0 (known at the time as v1.4.0) was meant to have a raid battle feature.</p>
<p>These would've been overworld battles against amalgamate bosses using the same attacking mechanic as in FFA. They would've been accessed through raid portals, three of which become accessible every hour.</p>
<p>The player who deals the finishing blow to the boss claims the portal for their team (Team Love, Hate, Hope or Dream). If a team owns over two portals in one area, their EXP and gold earnings in that area are multiplied by 1.5.</p>
<hr>
<p>While actual raid battles aren't accessible, three rooms for the Ruins portals are left over. These rooms also include the raid HUD, but all of the text (other than "AMALGAM") seems to be vertically misaligned.</p>
<p>Another thing worth mentioning is that the HP shown here is not the player's actual HP stat, it's always 20.</p>
<p>These rooms were never modified after v2.0.0. However, the corners of the lighter areas now use the wrong tiles as the Ruins tileset was resprited in v2.5.0.</p>
<p>There are three rooms (IDs 211-213 in v2.0.0 and 262-264 in v2.7.13), likely for the three different portals in the Ruins, but all of them are identical.</p>
