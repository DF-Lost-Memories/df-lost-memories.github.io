<p>The help guide from <a href="/demo2/article.html?id=alternate-machine">this article</a> sets a variable of obj_game called unlockcell after being read for the first time.</p>
<p>Now, this variable doesn't actually do anything at all - but it was most likely related to a piece of code that adds functionality to the CELL option in the menu, which has been restored here.</p>
<p>This UI displays counters for soul pieces and puzzle pieces you've collected in the current timeline (or universe, as they're still referred to here) and in total.</p>
<p>Counters for the unused "key piece" collectibles are also added to this menu once you start collecting them.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the "forgotten world where genocide took place" doesn't have any stats set here. Instead, the "???" universe shows that there are 15 soul pieces and 18 puzzle pieces to collect.</p>
<p>As for key pieces, there are 5 in every universe.</p>
