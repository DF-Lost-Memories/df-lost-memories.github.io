<p>In the files of Demo 2, there's an unused version of Gaster's lab that tells a story through logs on computers. It's possible that this was an earlier version of the Forgotten Lab.</p>
<br>
<p>You start in an entrance with a screen signaling that Private Labs A, B, C, D and E are up ahead. Going to the next room... crashes the game.</p>
<p>Yes, the hallway normally crashes the game due to a reference in code to a missing "machine room". The video on this page was from a copy that was modded to fix the issue.</p>
<p>At the end of said hallway is a locked door leading to Private Lab E. To unlock it, you must go through every computer to find one that can open the door.</p>
<p>You can visit the first four Private Labs in any order, and the messages from the computers will show up in the intended order regardless of which computer you actually checked (in the video, I went with the order suggested by the internal room names).</p>
<p>The first 3 computers contain logs written by the Gaster followers, talking about how Gaster hired them to work on a project that he's yet to reveal, how they've been hearing explosions from Private Lab E where Gaster spends all of his time, and how they found out about the existence of the machine they're here to test. For the sake of brevity, the exact messages won't be transcribed here (just watch the video...).</p>
<p>The 4th computer lets you unlock the <span title="The computer refers to it as &quot;power room&quot;, but this might be because the sprite was repurposed for the actual power room in the Forgotten Lab.">Machine Room/Private Lab E</span>. Except the door doesn't actually go anywhere, and I once again had to mod it to function as an exit.</p>
<p>The machine room... well, doesn't exist at all. It was completely removed from the game, unlike the rest of the Private Labs. The empty room with a computer that you see in the video was made by me in an attempt to fill in the gaps and showcase the final computer that otherwise isn't accessible.</p>
<p>This last computer contains a message from Gaster himself, detailing that the so-called "machine" allows for interuniversal travel, that he wasn't sure if it'd work with monsters because they don't have determination, and that testing needed to begin soon. It's <em>very</em> likely that the actual machine would've been in this room as well, but not functional before the next encounter...</p>
<p>The room to the right of this one contains a wormhole. It leads to a very simple dodging section, and a glitchy portal that leads you to a room where you meet Gaster.</p>
<p>After walking into the room, Gaster talks about how he's beyond saving and that Frisk should just ignore him and continue their journey to save Monsterkind. After they choose to stay in the room (because you are forced to), he tells them that they must collect his 55 soul pieces that were scattered across the multiverse, using the machine to travel to different universes.</p>
<p>Which ties in nicely with the next article in this series, <a href="article.html?id=alternate-machine&main=demo2-main">Alternate Machine UI</a>.</p>
