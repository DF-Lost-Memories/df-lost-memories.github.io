        <h3>Rock Room</h3>
        <video src="rockroom.mp4" controls></video>
        <p>Room 210 in v2.5.2 or 265 in v2.7.12 is a rock pushing puzzle room that would've been placed between the then-unused second rock puzzle and Leaf Pile rooms.</p>
        <p>The room consists of a rectangular area almost completely filled with pushable rocks. The player must push some of the rocks to the 3 buttons while also making sure to leave a path to move forward, as it is possible to get softlocked in this room.</p>
        <p>While the rest of this part of the Ruins below the fountain was finally made accessible in v2.7.9, this room was still left unused.</p>

        <h3>Spike Bridge</h3>
        <video src="spikebridge.mp4" controls></video>
        <p>Room 41 in v2.5.2 and v2.7.8b, or 46 in v2.7.12, is a room where the player has to traverse a bridge made out of spikes over a body of water.</p>
        <p>At the start of the room is a sign that reads:</p>
        <img class="textbox" data-text="PRO TIP: You can sprint       by holding down [X]!">
        <img class="textbox" data-text="Don't get caught in the       spikes!">
        <p>The spikes will all activate once the player approaches the bridge. They will then start deactivating in a certain pattern which seems to be rather buggy, thus preventing the player from progressing.</p>
        <p>It is possible, although difficult, to complete this room if starting from the other end of the bridge, however.</p>

    <h3>Honorable mention: Fixed Holes</h3>
    <p>While this room was used during the <span style="color: var(--olddfc)">"Old DFC"</span> era, it was actually updated after v2.4.3b, notably the text on the sign.</p>
