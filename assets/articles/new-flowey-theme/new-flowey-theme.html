<p>There is an unused remix of Undertale's <em>Your Best Friend</em> in the files. It can be listened to by editing a .dfmap file's music value to 192 in v2.7.12. The file in the audio player above was ripped from a dfmap playing the song.</p>
<p>It's a slower, friendlier version of the song with piano accompanying the melody. The second loop adds a background instrumental, and a music box reminiscent of <em>His Theme</em> can be heard.</p>
<p>The silence at the very end of the file isn't long enough, so the loop isn't perfect.</p>

<p><a href="assets/articles/new-flowey-theme/music_room_old.dfmap">Here</a> is the original version that works on v2.7.9c. The music ID is 189 in this version.</p>
