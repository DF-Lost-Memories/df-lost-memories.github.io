<p>Sound 132 of audiogroup1.dat ever since v2.7.13 is an unused remix of Undertale's <em>Your Best Friend</em>.</p>
<p>It can also be listened to by changing a .dfmap file's music value to 196 in v2.7.14c.</p>
<p>It's a slower, friendlier version of the song with piano accompanying the melody. The second loop adds a background instrumental, and a music box reminiscent of <em>His Theme</em> can be heard.</p>
<p>The silence at the very end of the file isn't long enough, so the loop isn't perfect.</p>
