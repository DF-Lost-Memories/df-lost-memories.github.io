<p>Doge World is the unused 4th world of the now-scrapped Master Quest.</p>
<p>
It is a dark area consisting of two large rooms with a pale yellow grass(?) path, and tons of faceless dogs in the space outside of the path.<br>
The entrance to this area is the Dog Shrine from Undertale. <br>
At the end of the path, a "castle" can be found, made of dark, yellow-outlined brick tiles. Inside are eight pillars, a save point, and, <span title="In short, in offline mode in Legacy DFC. The reason Chapter 1 doesn't have the key is most likely because Master Quest is not playable in its story mode.">as long as the Master Quest is supposed to be accessible</span>, the blue key.<br>

However, this was never implemented.

<p>The gate to the castle is initially closed. The player must find <span title="Near the top left of the first room">the dog that has a face</span> in order to obtain an artifact which can open the gate.</p>
<p>The music that plays in this area is a slowed down version of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-245932155/adventures-end-rickyg" target="_blank">Adventure's End</a> by RickyG.</p>
<p>Here's a quick history of this world's accessibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Chapter 1 (v1.3.3), it can be accessed by going to room 128. Exiting the area leads the player to the fountain in Hometown.</li>
<li>Starting from v2.0.0, the entrance is accessible through normal gameplay, but the shrine door is blocked by a sign. The rest of the area can be explored by exploiting a collision oversight which will be explained later.</li>
<li>Starting from v2.2.0, the collision error has been fixed.</li>
<li>Starting from v2.4.0, the entrance of this world is replaced with a different room altogether.</li>
<li>As of v2.5.0, Doge World has been removed completely, as the Master Quest was scrapped and the existing worlds were repurposed as Lost Worlds.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The famed collision issue</h3>
<center><video src="dog-world-olddfc.mp4" controls></video></center>
<p>There is seemingly a gap in the collisions at the bottom right corner of the entrance room. By using the Chara vessel, it is possible to get through this gap, go out of bounds around the room and enter the shrine door from the back.</p>
