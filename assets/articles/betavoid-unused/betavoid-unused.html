<p>The Master Quest/Lost World layout of the "Beta Void" was not created specifically for DF v1.0.0.</p>
<p>This entire area is actually left over from Demo 2, where it would've been the second playable timeline after the Uppertale one. As the demo only contained one timeline, this was left unfinished in the files.</p>
<p>This page details the Demo 2 version, which includes more areas than the modern one, and also mentions some leftovers that were accessible until v2.5.0.</p>
<br>
<p>Going to room 53, you start in front of the machine, which would've been how you access this area in the first place. You then follow the same path as the modern Beta Void until you reach the central area of the second room...</p>
<p>In Demo 2, a SAVE point named <em>Void Hub - AU #270098682</em> is placed in this room:</p>
<center>
    <img class="textbox" data-text="(For some reason, this place feels very familiar to you.)">
    <img class="textbox" data-text="(You're filled with            determination.)">
</center>
<p>The three Froglitches in this room have different dialogue:</p>
<center>
    <img class="textbox" data-text="cmliYml0 cmliYml0...\n(Please don't hurt me...)">
    <img class="textbox" data-text="cmliYml0 cmliYml0!\n(Don't come any closer!)">
    <img class="textbox" data-text="cmliYml0 cmliYml0?\n(Why do I feel like I've      met you before?)">
</center>
<p>Going to the right leads you to the lab as normal. The Gasterbot door doesn't go anywhere.</p>
<p>Going down (there's a path that goes down) leads you to a different platform with 3 minecarts that go to the Ruins, Snowdin and Waterfall.</p>
<p>The Waterfall minecart doesn't do anything, and both the Ruins and Snowdin minecarts go to the entrance of the Desolate Ruins. It's very likely that the other minecarts would've gone to the void versions of Snowdin and Waterfall if this area was finished.</p>
<p>At the end of the first hallway of the Desolate Ruins, there's a sign that reads:</p>
<center>
    <img class="textbox" data-text="V2VsY29tZSB0byB0aGUgUnVpbnMu">
</center>
<p>When decoded in Base 64, this reads "Welcome to the Ruins.".</p>
<p>The next room is a replica of the first room of the Ruins. There is a save point named <em>Desolate Ruins - AU #270098682</em> that uses the default placeholder text.</p>
<p>After this room is a big, mostly empty one that has a <span title="There's a soul piece at the end, it's not in the video because I had already collected it.">wormhole level</span> inside. There is also a door that doesn't go anywhere and doesn't have collision, so it allows you to go out of bounds.</p>
<p>The level is actually part of a dedicated map of wormhole levels that would've appeared in the Beta Void. The map isn't complete, but it has two other levels that are inaccessible:</p>

<p>(The full map is 2220x1799 but it's mostly empty so I cropped it. I also added arrows to indicate what direction the glitches are supposed to go in.)</p>
<p>The third level would've had a fake wall that lead to a "key piece", a type of collectible that doesn't appear in the demo.</p>
<hr>
<p>While the Beta Void was changed to its modern layout with its inclusion in Chapter 1 Multiplayer's Master Quest, the minecart area still remained and could be accessed by noclipping until v2.4.3b.</p>

<p>The Waterfall minecart still doesn't do anything, and both others warp you to the first room of the area.</p>
<p>This area was removed in v2.5.0. The room is now vertically shorter, so the unused part is cut off entirely.</p>
