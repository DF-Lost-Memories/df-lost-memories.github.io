<p>There's a completely inaccessible area off-screen in the second room of the Beta Void (Master Quest World 2 / Lost World 3)</p>
<p>It's a simple, circular (not really) platform with 3 minecart tracks going left, right and downwards.</p>
<p>The minecarts are interactable. They bring up a message asking you if you want to go to the Ruins for the one on the left, Snowdin for the one at the bottom and Waterfall for the one on the right.</p>
<p>The Waterfall minecart does nothing. The Ruins and Snowdin ones just put you in the first room of the Beta Void, <span title="To be fair, I have no idea why it goes THERE specifically. It's not because it's your previous room, as coming in from the third room and using the minecart also brings you to the first room. Maybe it's because it's the previous room in the game's room list.">likely due to an actual room not being set for their warp</span>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this area is unknown. It looks like fast travel, but the puzzling part is that Hometown and Master Quest worlds were the only areas accessible in Chapter 1 Multiplayer - Ruins, Snowdin and Waterfall were not in the game.</p>
<p>The tracks at the bottom and on the right simply go all the way to the edges of the room. The one on the left seemingly goes behind a big rock (shich is also off-screen).</p>

<p>This area was removed in v2.5.0. The room is now vertically shorter, so the unused part is cut off entirely.</p>
