<p>Room 147 in v1.3.3 contains a different version of Gaster and Harlow's meeting in the Inner Void than the one that is used in the game.</p>
<p>This version shows the characters' overworld sprites on a white background. After Harlow gets up, Gaster walks in from the right and begins his monologue (which is exactly the same as the final version).</p>
<p>At the end, the game anti-climactically fades back to the machine room, and wormholes and puzzle pieces become available.</p>
<p>Wind sounds are played throughout the entire cutscene. They also don't stop playing after the cutscene...</p>
<p>The cutscene can be skipped by spamming [Z/ENTER] before Gaster starts talking.</p>
