<span class="determination">* Nice work.
* Seems like this place is
  finally opened up again.
<hr>* I guess I'll hold up
  my end of the deal and
  leave your SOUL intact.
<hr>* I can leave now too,
  so I'm gonna go figure
  out what's going on.
<hr>* By the way, I looked
  inside to see where
  the old hag was...
<hr>* But she's not inside.
* Not in the kitchen
  or any of the rooms.
<hr>* It's none of my
  concern, though.
* Do as you will.
<hr>* Anyway, maybe I'll
  see you at some point
  up ahead.
<hr>* Until then, try not to
  get yourself killed.
<hr>* After all, in this world,
  it's <span title="(Shaky text)">KILL or BE KILLED</span>.
<hr>* Remember that.
* Now get lost.
