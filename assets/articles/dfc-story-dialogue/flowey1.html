<hr>* You better explain
  what's going on here,
  or I will <span title="(Shaky text)">end you</span>.
<hr>* ...
<hr>* Uh, are you braindead?
* Why are you so calm?
* I just THREATENED you.
<hr>* You're acting like you
  already know me.
* Have we met before?
<hr>* ...
<hr>* Well, I'm pretty sure
  that I don't know you.
<hr>* But maybe there was a
  time when I once did.
* Am I right?
<hr>* Maybe we were even...
  best friends?
<hr>* Pft, you're an idiot.

  that means nothing now.

<hr>* If I had to guess,
  you're not even the one
  in control here anyway.
<hr>* Someone else must be
  pulling the strings,
  it can't be you.
<hr>* Maybe it's...
* No, it couldn't be.
<hr>* At the very least,
  this is certainly
  getting interesting.
<hr>* And since you're here,
  maybe I can get some
  use out of you.
<hr>* You see, there's
  something preventing me
  from leaving the RUINS.
<hr>* My guess is some sort
  of magic is keeping
  this place sealed off.
<hr>* I've noticed that the
  <span style="color:yellow">old hag's</span> house has
  been blocked off, too.
<hr>* There's no other way
  out of this place,
  so I'm stuck here.
<hr>* ...
<hr>* So look, I'll cut you
  a deal, just this once.
<hr>* If you can get rid of
  whatever is keeping
  me stuck here...
<hr>* Then I <span title="(Shaky text)">MIGHT</span> let you
  leave this place with
  your SOUL intact.
<hr>* What do you say?
* Do we have a deal?
<hr>* Great, now get to it.
* I'll be waiting by
  the <span style="color:yellow">old hag's house</span>.
