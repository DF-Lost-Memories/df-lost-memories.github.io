<span class="determination">* HEY!
* Watch out!
* Don't step on me!
<hr>* (You look down at your feet,
  and spot a small caterpillar
  you nearly stepped on.)
<hr>* GEEZ! Watch where you're
  going, my life flashed
  before my eyes just now!
<hr>* Huh? What am I?
* I'm a SILKWORM, duh!
* We live here in the RUINS.
<hr>* You've probably passed
  by a lot of us and didn't
  notice since we're so small...
<hr>* Be careful not to step on
  any of us, or else our
  leader <span style="color:red">MANDARINA</span> will get mad!
<hr>* You better watch out for
  her, she doesn't take too
  kindly to intruders...
<hr>* Now if you'll excuse me, I
  have a meeting for the RUINS
  RENOVATION TEAM to attend.
<hr>* (The silkworm slithers away.)
