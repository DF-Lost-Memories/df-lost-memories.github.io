<p>In the files, there is a room that contains a boss fight agains Gaster Follower 3.</p>
<p>The boss portal object has code that puts you in this room if the boss ID is set to 1, so I changed the ID of the one in the final level to that.</p>
<p>(The boss room is named rm_boss_uppertale, and the first timeline is always referred to as Uppertale, so it's likely that this was the intended placement.)</p>
<br>
<p>After a bit of dialogue about how Gaster caused him to be trapped in this void, F3 offers to give you a soul piece if you can dodge his attacks for a minute.</p>
<p>The actual boss fight takes place in the wormhole level style (instead of a normal Undertale battle) and involves, as expected, dodging bullets coming from eyes on either side of the screen while the boss flies around.</p>
<p>You can also fire bullets using [Z/ENTER] to destroy F3 or the eyes. The eyes have 100 HP, the boss has 1000, and your bullets deal 5 damage.</p>
<p>You have 3 lives and dying causes the game to softlock in a black screen.</p>
<p>As he takes damage, F3 will start moving faster. The eyes will start shooting faster as the timer counts down as well.</p>
<p>The eyes stop shooting if F3 is killed. Other than this, killing or sparing him makes no difference whatsoever, and you'll still need to wait for the timer to run out.</p>
<br>
<p>Defeating the boss doesn't actually grant you the final soul piece...</p>
