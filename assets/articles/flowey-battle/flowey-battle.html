    <img class="textbox" data-text="FLOWEY - 19 ATK 0 DEF.\nYour new best friend!">
    <p>Room 150 in v1.3.3 is a battle against Flowey.</p>
    <p>The music used is <em>Your Best Friend</em>. It stops playing on turn 6</p>

        <h3>In the normal state</h3>
        <img src="normalflower.png" alt="Flowey">
        <p>Checking or sparing him progresses the fight normally.</p>
        <p>Missing an attack or using an item will cause him to react with special lines, but won't progress the fight.</p>
        <p>Flowey doesn't attack on his first turn. On every other turn, he shoots friendliness pellets at the player.</p>
        <p>Touching a pellet crashes the game.</p>
        <p>Dealing damage to him causes him to get angry (see the other state). He will also react with a different line depending on whether he's attacked on the first turn or anytime else.</p>
        <p>Attacking and dealing 0 damage makes him switch to his angry sprite, changes the music pitch, and triggers the angry state flavor text. However, the fight still progresses as in the normal state.</p>
        <p>Flowey can be killed or spared when he is sparing the player.</p>

        <h3>In the angry state</h3>
        <img src="angryflower.png" alt="Angry Flowey">
        <p>The music is pitched down.</p>
        <p>Flowey uses a faster version of the attack pattern from his normal state.</p>
        <p>Touching a pellet instantly kills the player and brings up the normal game over screen.</p>
        <p>Missing or using an item causes him to react with special lines.</p>
        <p>Attacking him makes him react as if you attacked him for the first time, most likely due to an oversight.</p>
        <p>This state is essentially a softlock as Flowey can't be defeated and doesn't go back to th enormal state.</p>
