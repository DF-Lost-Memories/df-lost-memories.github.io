    Online Labs (known as multilab internally) refers to a location that would've served as the hub world for Demo 2's multiplayer update.<br>
    It was kept in the files all the way from v0.1.5 to the latest versions of DFC, and even updated twice despite never being used.<br>
    This article will cover this one location in all four major version categories on the website!

<p>The first room of the Online Labs, named <em>Entrance</em>, is a long hallway with a computer displaying an introductory message, and a rules sign last updated on 25th August 2018, three weeks before Demo 2's release.</p>
<p>The second room, the <em>Machine Room</em>, contains the machine used to travel to different timelines.</p>
<p>There is also a third room, the <em>Door Room</em>, disconnected from everything else which has a door that leads to the unused FFA mode, or as it was known at the time, PvP. Strangely, the door goes directly to the surface map instead of the menu.</p>
<p>The first room also has a secret path through the walls that leads to Demo 2's (also unused) version of the Classic Void.</p>

<p>Chapter 1 has the most developed version of the Online Labs.</p>
<p>A save point was added to the first room, alongside an entrance to the third room, where the gray door now leads to the Void Hub. Possibly unintentionally, as it wouldn't make a lot of sense to have two different hubs...</p>
<p>The second room was completely redesigned, with the machine now on a floating platform above a lab background. However, it is still the same object from Demo 2, which would begin crashing the game going forward.</p>
<p>The secret path leading to the Classic Void was "moved" to the left of the machine, where it is now just a straight path out of bounds leading to a platform with the void door.</p>
<p>The rules were updated again since the last version, the latest update being on 8th November 2018 this time.</p>

<p>While nothing was changed in v2.0.0, v2.1.0 removed quite a bit of stuff, including the door to the second room...?</p>
<p>Trying to go to the third room now brings you to the hub. The door itself inside the third room now brings you to a long gray hallway similar to the Void Hub (it also forces the gray Harlow skin).</p>
<p>While now inaccessible from the first room, the second room is unchanged.</p>

<p>To this day, the Online Labs are mostly unchanged from the v2.1.0 version. The biggest difference is the background behind the machine, which is now orange due to the sprite being repurposed for the CORE.</p>
<p>Other than that, the door inside the third room now brings you to the title screen...</p>
