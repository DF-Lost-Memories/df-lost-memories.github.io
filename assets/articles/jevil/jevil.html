<p>Jevil is an upcoming vessel in DF CONNECTED v2.8.0.</p>
<p>He's been in the vessel menu for a long time (and still is), but he's never been officially playable as he was intended to have a boss battle before being unlocked.</p>
<p>Emphasis on officially. He's actually been playable in offline mode this entire time through save editing (by simply changing a string to "Jevil", no less), and you may have seen hackers using him in online mode.</p>
<p>And by "this entire time", I mean since v2.0.0. He wasn't even shown in the vessel menu in that version.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean you can just go and use him in any version, however. There have been some measures to prevent him from being used:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In any version after v2.5.0, his sprites are replaced with Harlow's.</li>
    <li>In any version after v2.7.0, using him as your vessel will crash the game. <span title="This needs testing. Android builds show error messages before crashing - so if a mobile save is edited and no error is shown, that means it's an anti-cheat measure.">Presumably</span> not due to an error, but specifically to prevent hackers from using him (which hasn't exactly been successful)</li>
</ul>

        <h2>As a vessel</h2>
        <p>Prior to v2.5.0, the Jevil vessel shows all four overworld sprites, as seen below (ripped from screenshots):</p>

        <p>He doesn't have a dance (though he's getting three in v2.8.0).</p>
        <p>He also doesn't have any alternate skins.</p>
        <p>His battle sprite isn't normally visible in-game, but it has already been shown in teasers. Here's a rip from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmkJPP9liZY">UNDEREVENT 2023 Trailer</a>:</p>

        <h2>As a partner</h2>
        <p>Jevil's partner effect is Bonus EXP. He doesn't have a combo effect with any vessels.</p>
        <p>His P-Action flavor text reads:</p>
        <img src="battle.png" alt="* Jevil amazes the enemy with some spectacular tricks. * Jevil can do anything!">
        <img class="textbox" data-text="Jevil amazes the enemy with some spectacular tricks.\nJevil can do anything!">

        <h2>As a v2.7.9 partner</h2>
        <p>His portrait is visible in the STAT menu:</p>

        <p>This is his icon in the battle HUD:</p>
        <img src="icon.png" alt="Jevil's battle icon">
        <p>His P-Action is unsurprisingly named <span style="color: #8c7ce0">J-Action</span> and his associated color is <span style="color: #8c7ce0">#8c7ce0</span>.</p>
